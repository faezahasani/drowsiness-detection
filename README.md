Driver drowsiness detection has been the subject of many researches in the past few decades and various methods have been developed to detect it. In this study, as an image-based approach with adequate accuracy, along with the expedite process, we are thinki9ng to apply YOLOv3,  CNN for extracting facial features and LSTM neural network to learn driver temporal behaviors including yawning and blinking time period as well as sequence classification.
